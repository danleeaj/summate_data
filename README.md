Within each of the folders, there is the following:
* `README.md` containing details of the experiment
* `data/` directory containing all the outputs of the experiment / Autograder
* `analysis.ipynb` containing the code to analyze the data
* `figure.png` containing a figure, if any were made

\* Data is not uploaded to GitHub for privacy concerns. All potential identifiable factors are removed.
